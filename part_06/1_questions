1) What is Java inheritance?

- a sub-class can inherit (have access to) the variables and methods of a parent class and add it's own unique
elements

2) How does inheritance work?

- using the extends keyword:
SubClass extends ParentClass

3) What are some advantages that inheritance provides?

- If youÂ´ll have multiple classes that all have the same variables, you can create a parent class and only have to
    type out those variables once.
    One superclass can create any number of subclasses.

4) What does the "super" keyword do?

- refers to the parent class version of whatever super precedes (a variable or method)

5) In what order are constructors called when there are multiple subclasses?

- super to subclass (remember, super instance variables MUST be first in a subclass constructor)

6) What does it mean when a method is overridden?

when a method in a subclass has the same name as a method in a parent class

7) How do overridden methods support polymorphism?

- one shape many forms, one method can take different types of arguments

8) What is the difference between an overloaded method and an overridden method?

- an overloaded method is multiple versions of the same method within the same class
- an overridden method is a method of the same name that exists within two different classes (a parent
    and sub class)

9) What is dynamic method dispatch?

- involves super & sub classes & methods within those classes that have identical signatures, but inner code
may differ

10) What does the "final" keyword do?

does not allow a variable to be changed

11) Are classes in Java are a subclass of what super class?
object
