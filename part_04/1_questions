Answer the following questions:

1) What is an array?

- A collection of variables of the same type.
- Is a convenient means of grouping together related variables.

2) What the code required to create (instantiate) a String array with size 10 named "cats"?

String[] cats = new string[10];

3) What is a multidimensional array?

- arrays with 2 or more dimensions
- each dimension is placed in it's own brackets

4) What is the code required to create (instantiate) a 2-dimensional int array that is 6 high and 6 wide named
"scores"?

int[][] scores = new int[6][6];

5) Using code, how do you retrieve a String that is the 10th item in a traditional array named dogs?

String item10 = dogs[9];

6) What is an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException?

An error you'll receive if you try to overrun or underrun the array (ex it holds 10 items and you try to pass through
more or less than 10)
- when you request an item outside the bounds of the array

7) Using one line of code, demonstrate how to retrieve the second to the last item from a int array.

int secondToLast = arrayName[(arrayName.length)-2];

8) What is the maximum allowable size of an array in Java?

The max for int which is : 2147483647

9) What is a bubble sort?

- The bubble sort repeatedly compares adjacent elements of an array. The first and second elements are compared
and swapped if out of order.

- a very inefficient sorting algorithm. Requires a nested for loop, outer loop must run as many times as the
length of the collection -1. Inner loop compares sequential pairs and swaps them if need be.
Depending on whether you're starting from the bottom or the top, the (next) smallest number will bubble to the top
on each subsequent loop (or vice versa - largest to the bottom).

10) How does a bubble sort work?

It uses 2 nested for loops, the outer one starts at the first index and moves up to the <size>, the inner
for loop starts at size-1 and iterates down. An inner if statement checks if the current value (b-1) is greater than
the next index (b) and if so, they switch. The result is an index sorted from low to high.

11) When might you use an irregular array? What is a good example of an irregular array?

- A irregular array is when two or more indexes have differing dimensions (lengths).
- Book ex is airport shuttle that runs 10 times/day on weekdays and twice/day on weekends

12) Demonstrate how to iterate through an array, printing each value, using a for loop.

int arrayName[] = new int[10];

for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    System.out.println("Index " + i + " is" + arrayName[i]);

}

13) Demonstrate how to iterate through an array, printing each value, using a while loop.

int arrayName[] = new int[10];

int i = 0;

while (i < arrayName.length) {

    System.out.println("Index " + i + " is" + arrayName[i]);
    i++;

}

14) What is a queue?

- A list in which elements are accessed first in, first out order only
    (as opposed to a stack which is first in, last out)

- there is a built-in queue in java but we built our own

15) What are the two primary methods that a queue performs?

put - determines where next element of data will be store

get - determines at what location the next element of data will be obtained

16) What is a stack?

a list of elements that are accessed first in, last out

17) What differentiates stacks and queues?

the order in which the elements are accessed

18) When would you use an enhanced for loop? aka for each

when you want to iterate through every index of something, but you don't need access to the index

for (int i : x) in whatever

19) What is "The Collections Framework"? What classes does it include?

The Collections Framework is a set of classes that implement various data structures, such as lists, vectors,
sets, and maps.

20) How do you iterate over a two-dimensional array? Demonstrate using psuedo code.

if you have a 2-d array called arrayName, do this:

// enhanced for loop

for(int[] i : arrayName){
    for (int j : i){
    //do something
    }
}

//traditional for loop

for (int i = 0; i < dataArray.length; i++){

            for (int j = 0; j < dataArray[i].length; j++){

                sout(nums[i][j]);

            }

Note: nums.length is the vertical length
num[i].length is the horizontal length of each row

21) What is a String?

- a datatype composed of words
- it's an object type, not a primitive type

22) What are a few common methods for operating on Strings?
length(), indexOf(), lastIndexOf()

23) What does "Strings are immutable" mean?

the character sequence that makes up the string cannot be changed. Even if you're adding just one
character, the old String is deleted and a new one is created.

24) Using the CLI, how do you invoke a Java application and provide two parameters to the main method?

compile first: javac ClassName.java
enter in the command line: java ClassName parameter1 parameter2

must be in file that is root of the program
