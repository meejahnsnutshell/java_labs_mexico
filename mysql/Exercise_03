Using MySQLWorkbench do the following:

1) create a new blank database with the name "car_dealership"

2) create a new table named "users_cars" with the following fields: // lookup table
    - id (auto increment)
    - userID (refers to "id" in users table)
    - carID (refers to "id" in cars table)


2) create a new table named "users" with the following fields
    - id (auto increment)
    - first name
    - last name

3) create a new table named "cars" with the following fields
    - id (auto increment)
    - make
    - model
    - color
    - year

4) populate these tables with at least 5 records each - the more the merrier

5) Write the SQL queries to accomplish the following: (write each of your queries below for review)

    - select all records from users

    SELECT * FROM car_dealership.users;

    - select all records from cars where car make = "Toyota"

    SELECT * FROM car_dealership.cars
    WHERE make = "Toyota";

    - use a join to select the first name and car model of every user who has bought a car
    SELECT u.first_name, c.model
    FROM users u
    JOIN users_cars uc
    	on u.id = uc.user_id
    JOIN cars c
    	on c.id = uc.car_id;

    - use a join to select the first and last name of everyone who has bought a red car

    SELECT u.first_name, u.last_name
    FROM users u
    JOIN users_cars uc
    	on u.id = uc.user_id
    JOIN cars c
    	on c.id = uc.car_id
    WHERE c.color = "Red";

    - use an insert statement to create a new record in each table

    insert into car_dealership.cars values (6, "Ford", "Fiesta", "Yellow", 2015);
    insert into car_dealership.users values (6, "Joey", "Baggadonuts");
    insert into car_dealership.users_cars values (6, 6, 6);

    - use sql to update a record in the "cars" table

    update car_dealership.cars
    set model = "Forrester"
    where id = 4;

6) Using MySQLWorkbench, export the "users_cars", "users" and "cars" schema with all objects and data
into a self-contained sql file. - check the exported file into git
