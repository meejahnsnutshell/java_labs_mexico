Create a new class that is similar to MySQLAccess - it must be able to do the following things:
    - connect to the University DB - done in readDataBase()
    - select * from students - done in readDataBase()
    - map the resultSet to arrayList of Student POJOs - done in mapResultSetToObjects()
    - use an enhanced for loop to iterate over each student calling a custom toString method on each student
    object

// like we did today with courses, take out all unnecessary code.
