Using Mysql shell & MySQL Workbench do the following: write down each command you execute below for review.

- restore (populate) the sample employees database as illustrated here:
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/employee/en/employees-installation.html
(to restore the sample employees database, where instructions say: mysql -t < employees.sql, instead do:
mysql -u root -p -t < /home/the-meej/CodingNomads/sql/test_db-master/employees.sql (adjust to your pathname))

- connect to your mysql via command line
mysql -u root -p

- select a database to use

used MySQL Workbench for the rest..

- run a variety of select queries against the various tables in employees db
select * from employees.employees limit 10;

select distinct * from employees.departments;

SELECT salary FROM employees.salaries
where salary > 150000;

SELECT min(salary) from salaries;

SELECT max(salary) from salaries;

- use a join query against at least two tables

select e.first_name, d.dept_name
from employees e
join dept_emp de
	on e.emp_no = de.emp_no
join departments d
	on de.dept_no = d.dept_no;

- create a backup dump file of the employees database as illustrated here:
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/mysqldump-sql-format.html

from command line: mysqldump -u root -p employees > employeesdump.sql
