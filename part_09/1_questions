1) What is the difference between a byte stream and a character stream?

- Byte stream handles input/output of bytes.
- Character stream handles input/output of characters

2) List at least 3 examples of byte stream classes?

    1. DataInputStream - An input stream that contains methods for reading the Java
       standard data types
    2. DataOutputStream - An output stream that contains methods for writing the Java
       standard data types
    3. FileInputStream - Input stream that reads from a file

3) List at least 3 examples of character stream classes?

    1. BufferedReader - Buffered input character stream
    2. BufferedWriter Buffered output character stream
    3. CharArrayReader Input stream that reads from a character array

4) What is try-with-resources? Why is it super cool?

aka automatic resource management, try with resources automatically closes a file without having to
write the extra code to to do.

5) Demonstrate a try-wth-resources block:

try(FileInputStream fin = new FileInputStream(args[0])){

    do{
        i = fin.read();
        if(i != -1) {
            sout((char) i);
        }
    } while (i != -1);

} catch (IOException exc) {
    sout("error");
}

6) What does the read() method on the FileInputStream class return?

it reads a single byte of data and returns it as an int (-1 at the end of the file)

7) What is the documentation above of the FileInputStream class header say? (hint: inside /** ... */)

-- don't have this documentation..
class signature is: public class FileInputStream extends InputStream

8) Is a DataOutputStream used for bytes or characters?

- is a byte stream

9) What is a BufferedReader?

- Reads text from a character-input stream, buffering characters so as to provide for the efficient
    reading of characters, arrays, and lines.
- Is a wrapper class
- Loads line by line, makes reading bytes easier/more intuitive

10) Why does a BufferedReader require an InputStreamReader as an argument?

it's a wrapper, you need to convert to a character stream before using BufferedReader.

11) What does the InputStreamReader do with it's byte stream argument?

- It reads bytes and decodes them into characters

12) What is the difference between the read() and readLine() on BufferedReader?

- read() reads one character at a time
- readLine() reads a line at a time

13) Demonstrate instantiating a BufferedReader that will read a file called "yucatan_cenotes.txt"


try(BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("yucatan_cenotes.txt"))) {
